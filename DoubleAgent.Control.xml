<para>This event is sent only to the input-active client of a character. When the user clicks a character or its <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Icon">notification icon</see> with no input-active client, Double Agent sends the event to its active client. If the character is visible (<see cref="P:Character.Visible" /> is True), the user's action also sets the character's current input-active client as the last input-active client, sending the <see cref="E:Control.ActivateInput" /> event to that client, and then sending the Click event. If the character is hidden (<see cref="P:Character.Visible" /> is False), and the user clicks the character's <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Icon">notification icon</see> using button 1, the character is also automatically shown.
</para>
<note>Clicking a character does not disable all other character output. However, pressing the Listening key <em>does</em> flush the input-active character's output and triggers the <see cref="E:Control.RequestComplete" /> event, passing a <see cref="P:Request.Status" /> that indicates that the client's queue was interrupted.</note>

<para>Like the <see cref="M:Character.Speak" /> method, the Think method is a queued request that displays text in a <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see>, except that the Think <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see> differs visually. In addition, the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see> supports only the bookmark speech control tag (Mrk) and ignores any other speech control tags. Unlike <see cref="M:Character.Speak" />, the Think method does not change the character's animation state.
</para>
<para>The <see cref="T:Balloon" /> Object's properties affect the output of both the <see cref="M:Character.Speak" /> and Think methods. For example, the <see cref="T:Balloon" /> Object's <see cref="P:Balloon.Enabled" /> property must be True for text to display.
</para>
<para>Agent's automatic word breaking in the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see> breaks words using white-space characters (for example, SPACE or TAB). However, if it cannot, it may break a word to fit the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see>. In languages like Japanese, Chinese, and Thai where spaces are not used to break words, insert a Unicode zero-width space character (0x200B) between characters to define logical word breaks.
</para>
<note>To track the method's status, you can declare an object reference and set it to the method's <see cref="T:Request" /> Object return value.</note>
<note>Set the character's <see cref="P:Character.LanguageID" /> before using the Think method to ensure appropriate text display within the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Balloon">word balloon</see>.</note>
