<para>You <strong>cannot</strong> load the same character (a character having the same <see cref="P:Character.UniqueID" />) more than once from a single instance of the <see cref="T:Server" /> Object.

If you attempt to do this, Double Agent raises an error. However, you can create another instance of the <see cref="T:Server" /> Object and load the same character, because each <see cref="T:Server" /> Object instance is treated as an individual server client.

<para>The input-active client receives mouse and speech input events for the character. Double Agent sends this event only to the client that becomes input-active and the client that becomes non-input-active.
</para>
 This event can occur when the user uses your <see cref="T:Commands" /> Collection, for example, by choosing a <see cref="T:Commands" /> Collection entry in the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#VoiceCommands">Voice Commands</see> window or in the <see cref="e08466bc-419c-11e1-9d4f-002421116fb2#Menu">pop-up menu</see> window for a character. It can also occur when the user selects a character (by clicking or speaking its name), when a character becomes visible, or when the character of another client application becomes hidden. You can also call the <see cref="M:Character.Activate" /> method with <paramref name="State" /> set to 2 (<see cref="F:ActiveStateType.InputActive" />) to explicitly make the character topmost, which results in your client application becoming input-active and triggers this event. However, this event does not occur if you use the <see cref="M:Character.Activate" /> method only to specify whether or not your client is the active client of the character.</remarks>

<para>If you follow a <see cref="M:Character.Speak" /> or <see cref="M:Character.Think" /> call with a statement that changes this property, it may not affect the balloon's Visible state because the <see cref="M:Character.Speak" /> or <see cref="M:Character.Think" /> call gets queued, but the call to set this property does not.

<param name="Fast">A boolean value that indicates whether to skip the character's Hiding state animation.</param>
<param name="RequestID">An optional unique numeric value your application can use to track the method's status.</param>
<remarks>
<para>Double Agent queues the actions of the Hide method in the character's queue, so you can use it to hide the character after a sequence of other animations. You can play the action immediately by using the <see cref="M:Character.Stop" /> or <see cref="M:Character.StopAll" /> method before calling this method.
</para>
<note>Hiding a character can trigger the <see cref="E:Server.ActivateInputState" /> event of another client.</note>

<para>If you (or another client) successfully set Listening mode on and you attempt to set this property to True before the time-out expires, the method succeeds and resets the time-out.
